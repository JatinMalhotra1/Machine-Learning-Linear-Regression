# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression
# Online News Popularity
With help of linear regression we tried to check the auto corelatiion between loads and the shares of online news. We assumed higher the shares higher the popiularity. We found the auto correlation value much greater than 0.05 and hence we could not accept the null hypothese of values not being auto correlated. Hence we can say there is a strong relationship between the loads and shares of online news.
